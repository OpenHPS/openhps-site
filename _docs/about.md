# About
OpenHPS is a open source hybrid positioning system that allows developers to merge multiple positioning techniques and algorithms together in a graph structure. It is being developed by PhD Student [Maxim Van de Wynckel](https://wise.vub.ac.be/member/maxim-van-de-wynckel) as part of his research towards *Hybrid Positioning and Implicit Human-Computer Interaction* under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Beat Signer](https://wise.vub.ac.be/member/beat-signer).

It was created as a positioning framework that can support various different positioning techniques, both during the *online* and *offline* stage.
